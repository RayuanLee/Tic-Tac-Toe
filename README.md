# Tic-Tac-Toe

This game is a simple tic tac toe simulation for a C++ class project. What I chose to do was allow both players to successfully place their 'X' or 'O' on the game board only after correctly answering a math question. 
The program demonstrates a use of functions to check board placements, move player's piece, and evaluating users numerical answers to math questions.
